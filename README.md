## Description
 
 This timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions challenges the user to answer questions against the clock. If an answer is incorrect, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer and the next question will appear. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

 There were a number of challenges throughout this process, of which some still remain: pushing user data to an object array and displaying all high scores, as well as clearing the data. I understand adding new values to an array, but when in object form the entire object is replaced instead of adding another. It's great to know my strengths in JavaScript at this point, just as much as it is to clarify what I need to work on understanding.
